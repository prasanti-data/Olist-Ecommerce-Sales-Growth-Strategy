# Olist-Ecommerce-Sales-Growth-Strategy
Analysis of the Olist e-commerce dataset to explore sales trends, customer behavior, and regional demand. Includes data cleaning, EDA, correlation analysis, Linear Regression (R²=0.83), and predict sales using linear regression. Provides insights to improve logistics, seller performance, and sales growth.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Olist e-commerce dataset to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and regional demand. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, correlation studies, and predictive modeling to provide insights and forecasting for sales growth.

🎯 Objectives
Explore key factors that drive sales growth.

Study customer and seller behavior patterns.

Compare product category and regional performance.

Predict payment value using regression.

Forecast monthly revenue with time-series models.

📊 Key Insights
Price and payment value are strongly correlated.

Freight value is tied to product weight and volume.

Delivery delay is related to actual delivery time but not to review scores.

Home & Furniture and Health & Beauty lead demand, while Fashion underperforms across regions.

🛠️ Approach
Data Preparation – cleaning, handling missing values, and feature creation.

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – sales trends, correlations, and category-wise demand.

Modeling –

Linear Regression (R² = 0.83) to predict sales.

Recommendations – focus on top-performing categories, reduce delivery delays, and support weaker sellers.
