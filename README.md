### 🎯 Objectives
- **Explore key factors** that drive sales growth  
- **Study customer and seller behavior** patterns  
- **Compare product category and regional performance**  
- **Predict payment value** using linear regression  

---

### 📊 Key Insights
- Encourage cross-selling based on customer purchase patterns
- Top selling states: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro
- Product seasonality: Peak sales in November and December
- Identify high-value customers for targeted marketing and loyalty programs

### 🛠️ Approach
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature creation  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Sales trends, correlations, and category-wise demand  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Linear Regression (R² = 0.83) to predict payment value  
- **Recommendations:** Focus on top-performing categories, reduce delivery delays, support weaker sellers
