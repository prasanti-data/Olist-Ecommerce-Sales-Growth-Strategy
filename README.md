# 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Olist e-commerce dataset to understand sales trends, customer behavior, and regional demand. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, correlation studies, and predictive modeling to generate insights and forecast sales growth.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- **Explore key factors** that drive sales growth  
- **Study customer and seller behavior** patterns  
- **Compare product category and regional performance**  
- **Predict payment value** using regression models  
- **Forecast monthly revenue** with time-series models  

---

### 📊 Key Insights
- **Price and payment value** are strongly correlated  
- **Freight value** is tied to product weight and volume  
- **Delivery delay** is related to actual delivery time but not review scores  
- **Home & Furniture** and **Health & Beauty** lead demand, while **Fashion** underperforms  

---

### 🛠️ Approach
- **Data Preparation:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature creation  
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Sales trends, correlations, and category-wise demand  
- **Modeling:**  
  - Linear Regression (R² = 0.83) to predict payment value  
- **Recommendations:** Focus on top-performing categories, reduce delivery delays, support weaker sellers
